# GLFNet: A Global–Local Feature Fusion Network for Driver Distraction Recognition
# 🚗 Project Driver Distraction Recognition Project



# 📦 Datasets Overview

This folder contains two main datasets used in this project:

---

## 📁 SF3D

The **SF3D** dataset refers to the **State Farm Distracted Driver Detection** dataset, originally from the Kaggle competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection

It includes images of drivers performing various tasks (safe driving, texting, talking on the phone, etc.) for distraction behavior classification.

---

## 📁 AUC

The **AUC** dataset refers to the **AUC Distracted Driver Dataset**, which is an academic dataset published by the American University in Cairo.
It contains annotated images of drivers under different distraction categories for training and evaluating recognition models.
